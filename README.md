# Genetic Data Visualization

This is a Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing and analyzing genetic data. It allows users to load FASTA files, visualize chromosome data in a 3D plot, and explore genetic variations.

## Features

- Load FASTA Files: Users can upload one or more FASTA files containing DNA or protein sequences.
- Chromosome Visualization: The application generates a 3D plot to visualize the chromosome data. Users can select a chromosome from the loaded datasets and explore its structure.
- Highlight SNPs: Users can choose to highlight Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in the visualization, making it easier to identify genetic variations.
- Dropdown Menus: The GUI includes dropdown menus for dataset selection, providing a convenient way to switch between different chromosomes.
- User-Friendly Interface: The application is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and interactive components.

## Requirements

To run the application, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or above)
- Tkinter
- BioPython
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   python main.py

2. Click on the "Open FASTA Files" button to load your FASTA files.

3. Explore the loaded datasets by selecting a chromosome from the dropdown menus.

4. Use the checkbox option to highlight SNPs in the visualization.

5. Enjoy exploring and analyzing the genetic data!
